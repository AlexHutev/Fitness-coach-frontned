**Services**:
- `ProgramService` - All program-related operations
- `ExerciseService` - Exercise library management
- Error handling and loading states

## üöÄ How to Test the Functionality

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Backend Server Running**: `cd C:\university\fitness-coach && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. **Frontend Server Running**: `cd C:\university\fitness-coach-fe && npm run dev` (now running on port 3000)

### **Testing Steps**

#### **1. Test Program View**
```
1. Open browser: http://localhost:3000/programs
2. Login with: trainer@fitnesscoach.com / trainer123
3. Click "View" button on any program
4. Verify you can see:
   ‚úì Program details (name, type, difficulty, duration)
   ‚úì Day-by-day workout structure
   ‚úì Exercise details with sets, reps, weight, rest
   ‚úì Muscle groups for each exercise
   ‚úì Edit, Duplicate, Delete, and Assign buttons work
```

#### **2. Test Program Edit**
```
1. From programs list, click "Edit" button on any program
2. Verify you can:
   ‚úì Edit program name and description
   ‚úì Change program type and difficulty
   ‚úì Modify duration and sessions per week
   ‚úì Add new workout days
   ‚úì Remove workout days (if more than 1)
   ‚úì Add exercises to workout days
   ‚úì Edit exercise parameters (sets, reps, weight, rest)
   ‚úì Remove exercises from workout days
   ‚úì Use exercise selector modal with search and filters
   ‚úì Save changes and see success message
   ‚úì Cancel without saving and get confirmation
```

#### **3. Test Exercise Selector**
```
1. In edit mode, click "Add Exercise" for any day
2. Verify exercise selector modal:
   ‚úì Shows list of available exercises
   ‚úì Search functionality works
   ‚úì Filter by muscle group works
   ‚úì Filter by equipment works
   ‚úì Clicking exercise adds it to the workout day
   ‚úì Modal closes after selection
```

#### **4. Test Data Persistence**
```
1. Edit a program and save changes
2. Navigate away and come back
3. Verify changes were saved
4. Test on different programs
```

## üìã Button Functions Summary

| **Back** | Navigate to previous page | `router.back()` |
| **Edit** | Go to edit page | `router.push('/programs/{id}/edit')` |
| **Duplicate** | Create copy of program | `ProgramService.duplicateProgram()` |
| **Delete** | Delete program with confirmation | `ProgramService.deleteProgram()` |
| **Assign to Clients** | Go to assignment page | `router.push('/programs/assignments?program={id}')` |
| **Start Workout** | Future feature | Ready for implementation |

### **Edit Page Buttons**
| Button | Function | Implementation |

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **State Management**
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state
- Change tracking for unsaved changes detection
- Loading and error states for API operations

### **TypeScript Integration**

- Generic components for reusability
- Proper error handling with typed responses

### **UI/UX Features**
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading spinners and skeletons
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Success/error notifications
- Sticky navigation and sidebars

### **Performance Considerations**
- Efficient exercise loading with caching
- Debounced search in exercise selector
