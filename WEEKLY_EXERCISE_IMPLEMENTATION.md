# Weekly Exercise View Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive weekly exercise view to client profiles, allowing clients to review and track their assigned exercises for each day of the week. The feature integrates with the existing Weekly Assignment system created by trainers.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Weekly Exercise Display**: Shows all assigned exercises organized by day of the week
- **Progress Tracking**: Track completion of individual sets and entire workouts
- **Two View Modes**: 
  - **Overview Mode**: Grid layout showing daily summaries with progress

- **Personal Notes**: Clients can add notes about how workouts felt
- **Trainer Notes**: Display trainer instructions and form cues
- **Visual Progress**: Progress bars and completion percentages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### ✅ Components Created
- `WeeklyExerciseView.tsx`: Main component for displaying weekly exercises
- Updated client profile page with new "Weekly Exercises" tab
- Updated client dashboard with weekly exercises section

### ✅ Data Persistence
- Uses localStorage to persist completion status and notes
- Maintains state across sessions
- Tracks individual set completions and workout notes

## File Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── clients/
│       ├── WeeklyExerciseView.tsx     # Main weekly exercise component
│       └── ClientPrograms.tsx          # Existing component (unchanged)
├── app/
│   ├── clients/
│   │   └── [id]/
│   │       └── page.tsx                # Updated with new tab
│   └── client/
│       └── dashboard/
│           └── page.tsx                # Updated with weekly exercises tab
└── weekly-exercise-demo.html           # Demo page showing the feature
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Flow
1. Trainers create weekly assignments using the existing Weekly Assignment feature
2. `WeeklyExerciseView` fetches active program assignments for the client
3. Filters assignments to show only those with `workout_structure` data
4. Displays exercises organized by day with progress tracking

### 2. Progress Tracking
- **Set Completion**: Click individual set buttons to mark completion
- **Day Completion**: Mark entire day as complete
- **Notes**: Add personal notes for each workout day
- **Persistence**: All progress saved to localStorage with client ID

### 3. UI Modes
- **Overview Mode**: Grid cards showing daily summaries
- **Detailed Mode**: Full exercise details with expandable sections
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts layout for smaller screens

## Integration Points

### Client Profile Page
- Added new "Weekly Exercises" tab alongside existing tabs
- Shows exercises specific to that client
- Trainers can view client progress and notes

### Client Dashboard
- Added tab navigation between "Dashboard Overview" and "My Weekly Exercises"
- Direct access for clients to view and track their workouts
- Integrates with existing authentication system

## Data Structure

### WorkoutDay Interface
```typescript
interface WorkoutDay {
  day: number;
  name: string;
  exercises: {
    exercise_id: number;
    exercise_name: string;
    sets: number;
    reps: string;
    weight: string;
    rest_seconds: number;
    notes?: string;
  }[];
}
```

### Completion Tracking
```typescript
interface DayCompletion {
  [dayName: string]: {
    completed: boolean;
    completedSets: { [exerciseIndex: number]: number };
    notes: string;
    completedDate?: string;
  };
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Trainers
1. Create weekly assignments using Programs → Assignments → Weekly Assignment
2. Assign exercises to specific days with sets, reps, weight, and notes

- Lucide React icons
- Tailwind CSS classes

### API Integration
- Uses existing `ProgramAssignmentService.getAssignments()` method
- Filters for active assignments with workout_structure data
- No additional backend changes required

### State Management

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

- Tab navigation and view mode switching
- Data persistence across browser sessions

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully adds a comprehensive weekly exercise view to the FitnessCoach application, enhancing the client experience by providing clear visibility into their assigned workouts and progress tracking capabilities.
